    community. Led by IU School of Medicine, the clinic strives to close the

  <!-- Clinic History -->
  <div class="history">
    <div class="history-info">
      <p>
        In February of 2009, Jim Streitlemier, pastor of the nondenominational
        Neighborhood Fellowship Church, located in the area of 10th and Rural in
        Indianapolis, and Dr. Javier Sevilla, primary care physician and
        instructor at Methodist/IU Hospital, joined forces to utilize the church
        to open a free clinic to serve the poor of Indianapolis.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since then, the clinic has continued to grow with the assistance of many
        community partners, including IU, UIndy and Butler University. The
        clinic has also been blessed to have had many hundreds of volunteers
        helping to organize things each week.

    <div id="accordionContent" class="accordion-content">
      <h2>Can I sign up for an appointment?</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, the Medicine team does not have appointments and we are
        “first come, first serve.” Other clinic partners do have appointments
        and you can get an appointment when you come to the clinic and are
        referred to them.
      </p>

      <h2>What time is the earliest I can arrive?</h2>
      <p>You can arrive as early as 8:30 am.</p>

      <h2>What time is the earliest I can arrive?</h2>
      <p>You can arrive as early as 8:30 am.</p>

      <h2>What time does the clinic start seeing patients?</h2>
      <p>We start seeing patients at 10am.</p>

      <h2>What does "first come, first serve" mean?</h2>
      <p>
        It means that we see patients in order of when they arrive. We encourage
        patients to come early (close to 8:30 am) if they want to be seen
        earlier.
      </p>

      <h2>Do I have to pay for anything?</h2>
      <p>
        The Student Outreach Clinic is completely free. You will never be asked
        to pay for anything. If we do not have the medicine that you need, we do
        have the option of sending it to a nearby pharmacy, in which case you
        would have to pay.
      </p>

      <h2>Do I need insurance to come to the clinic?</h2>
      <p>
        No, you do not need to have health insurance to be seen at the clinic.
      </p>

      <h2>Can I bring my children to be seen at the clinic?</h2>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, we do not have pediatricians present at the clinic, so we
        are not able to see children. The only exception is we do sports
        physicals in the fall for middle school and high school age students.

        "The IUSOC provides patients with the level of kindness and
        understanding that all medical facilities should strive to achieve, and
        overtime it has become a major pillar of the Indianapolis free clinic
        community. It allowed me to develop more than just my medical knowledge
        but also the sympathy and patience needed to practice truly patient
        centered care, which will serve me long after I've graduated medical
        school."

        the neighbors emotionally and physically. The relationships I have

    Research at the SOC is centered on service appraisal, impact measurement,
    and quality improvement. Through an interdisciplinary approach, the goal of
    the Research Team is to offer evidence-based recommendations and ensure that
    services at the SOC align with the standard of care. Currently, Medicine
    (including subgroups like Women's Health, Ophthalmology, and Mental Health
    Services) and Nursing are part of the current Research infrastructure,
    though ideally, the Research Team will grow to include members from ALL
    clinic partners.
