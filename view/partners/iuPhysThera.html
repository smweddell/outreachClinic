  <p>
    Indiana University Student Outreach Clinic Physical Therapy (IU SOC PT) started in 2012 as a collaborative partner with IU Student Outreach Clinic. The mission of the IU SOC PT clinic is to provide patient education, improve movement dysfunction, identify health risk factors, alleviate pain and enhance functional mobility for a variety of neuromusculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary conditions. Through inter-professional collaboration and education, student volunteers contribute to the patientsâ€™ physical, emotional, and social needs. Additionally, we offer pelvic floor physical therapy once per semester for various pelvic conditions. Physical therapy services are provided by IU and UIndy DPT students under the mentorship of upperclassmen and the guidance of licensed physical therapists.
