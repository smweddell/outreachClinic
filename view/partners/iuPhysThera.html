    Indiana University Student Outreach Clinic Physical Therapy (IU SOC PT)
    started in 2012 as a collaborative partner with IU Student Outreach Clinic.
    The mission of the IU SOC PT clinic is to provide patient education, improve
    movement dysfunction, identify health risk factors, alleviate pain and
    enhance functional mobility for a variety of neuromusculoskeletal and
    cardiopulmonary conditions. Through inter-professional collaboration and
    education, student volunteers contribute to the patientsâ€™ physical,
    emotional, and social needs. Additionally, we offer pelvic floor physical
    therapy once per semester for various pelvic conditions. Physical therapy
    services are provided by IU and UIndy DPT students under the mentorship of
    upperclassmen and the guidance of licensed physical therapists.

  <h2 class="partners-header">How to get involved as a student</h2>

  <p class="partner-info">
    As a IU Doctorate of Physical Therapy (DPT) student, first years are
    required to volunteer at least once during their first academic year. Second
    and 3rd years are sent a volunteer sign-up sheet at the beginning of each
    semester to sign up on available clinic dates.
