  <p class="partner-info">
    We are a student run organization through Robert H. McKinney School of Law.
    Volunteers are current law students with McKinney. We have been a partner
    with the clinic since 2010. We provide law students with real, hands-on
    experience with helping individuals with their legal needs. We serve as a
    resource bank to connect neighbors to various legal services. We can help
    with legal matters including, but not limited to, landlord-tenant issues,
    benefit denial or management, name changes, trusts & estates, family law,
    domestic violence, and immigration.
