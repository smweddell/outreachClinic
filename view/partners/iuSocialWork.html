    Social Work joined the clinic in 2011 with a mission to foster social and
    economic change in the Near Eastside by building relationships with
    community members, collaborating with existing networks, increasing
    awareness of health disparities, and promoting education while improving the
    skills of social work students to understand the strengths, dignity, and
    hope in all.
