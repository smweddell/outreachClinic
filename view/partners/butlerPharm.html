    Butler University Community Outreach Pharmacy (BUCOP) is a student-run
    pharmacy organization that provides pharmacy services free of charge to our
    neighbors in the East side of Indianapolis in partnership with Indiana
    University Student Outreach Clinic (IUSOC) since 2009. Our pharmacy services
    include but are not limited to provision of free medications to treat a
    variety of acute and chronic illnesses, patient assistance programs and
    medication counseling. We provide unique educational opportunities to
    Butlerâ€™s student pharmacists. As an organization, we strive to give back to
    our community and help build the next generation of health care leaders and
    patient advocates for years to come. As a clinic, we are strong advocates
    for universal access to adequate, safe, and affordable healthcare for those
    in need throughout Indianapolis.
