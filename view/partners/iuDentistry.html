    Welcome! We represent the IU School of Dentistry. We have been providing
    care in the Student Outreach Clinic since 2011. Our student volunteers come
    from the Doctor of Dental Surgery Program in all four years. We are able to
    provide dental treatment under the supervision of our volunteer faculty. At
    the clinic, we treat urgent and acute needs, including dental pain,
    orofacial pain, swellings, and trauma. Common treatments we perform include
    oral examinations, restorations (fillings), and extractions.
