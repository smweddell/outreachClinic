    Donations of time, money and supplies are instrumental to the success of the
    IU Student Outreach Clinic. With your help, local health care professionals
    and trainees can continue to provide free health services to the individuals
    who need it most. Support of this project also helps IU School of Medicine
    create a new generation of physicians with a personal commitment to the
    well-being of the Indianapolis community.

    From medical equipment to office supplies, the IU Student Outreach Clinic is
    always in need of various items. However, the clinic cannot accept expired
    items, sharps or needles, or advanced equipment beyond the scope of an
    outpatient care clinic such as bladder catheters, endotracheal tubes, etc.
