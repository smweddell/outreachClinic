          Donations of time, money and supplies are instrumental to the success
          of the IU Student Outreach Clinic. With your help, local health care
          professionals and trainees can continue to provide free health
          services to the individuals who need it most. Support of this project
          also helps IU School of Medicine create a new generation of physicians
          with a personal commitment to the well-being of the Indianapolis
          community.

          From medical equipment to office supplies, the IU Student Outreach
          Clinic is always in need of various items. However, the clinic cannot
          accept expired items, sharps or needles, or advanced equipment beyond
          the scope of an outpatient care clinic such as bladder catheters,
          endotracheal tubes, etc.
